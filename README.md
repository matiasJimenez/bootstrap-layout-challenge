Both the header and the main content should be responsive.

- For smaller screens options should be arranged in a column.

**Main content:**

- The width of the container should be 100% until `md`.
- Content should arrage in rows and cols as shown in the video
- Cards should arrange responsively. This means that their layout has to change according to the screen size.
  - For `xs` there should be 1 card per row, for `sm` 2 and for `lg` and bigger 3.
- The gutter should be `8px` by default and `12px` from `lg` and upper.
